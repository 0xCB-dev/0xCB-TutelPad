# TurtlePad buildguide WIP
1. (Optional) Solder on the WS2812B LEDs (this is the first step because it would be hard to solder them on nicely if you have other parts in the way).
2. Solder the diodes (currently just THT diodes). Make sure you match the black line on the diode with the thicker white line on the PCB.
3. Solder in the hotswap sockets. You can use Kailh or Gateron sockets, make sure the cutouts for the switches are clear, so you can actually insert a switch.

4. Solder the reset switch **on the top of the PCB**.
5. Solder the Pro Micro controller on the back of the PCB, with the smooth side towards the PCB. Be sure to cut the legs nice and short on the top of the PCB.
6. Solder in the OLED. Be sure you solder it on the top of the PCB (where the switches go).
